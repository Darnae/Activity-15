Lucky Number


For this assignment, I had to create an application that allowed for switching between two forms. I also had to implement the concept of Lucky Numbers into my application as well. We were allowed to perform the calculations in any way we wish, So I choose to make a variable that held the calculations for my personal lucky number. There is a button event that swtiches to the form with the result and text that tells what the lucky number is. 

On the first form, there are 3 combo boxes. One that was made using code rather than adding it straight from the toolbox. The second had its items created by items of the first textbox. And the last one was made normally. And Finally, there is a Text box that allows for user input.
